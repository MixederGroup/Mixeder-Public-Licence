Why does MixederGroup license all its service scripts?
Why does MixederGroup grant MixederPublicLicence to all service scripts? 

There are important reasons for this. It is to protect our users from unauthorized spoofing. 

If the code is used by an unauthorized spoofing site, the license allows Mixeder to enforce its copyright and deal with the code.

 In this way, MixederGroup protects its users from fraudulent activities and others by granting MixederPublicLicence to all proprietary scripts.
